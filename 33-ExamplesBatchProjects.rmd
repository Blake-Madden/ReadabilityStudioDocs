# Batch Projects

In this chapter, we will step through examples showing how to analyse batches of documents.

## Reviewing a Collection of Documents {-}

To determine the readability of a document collection, you will need to create a new batch project. First, click the `r keyboardButton("New")` button on the **Home** tab to open the **Select Project Type** dialog, as shown below:

![](Images/selectprojecttype.png)

Select **Batch Project** and click the `r keyboardButton("OK")` button to proceed to the **New Project Wizard** dialog:

![](Images/wizardbatchselectfiles.png)

Select **English** as the document language. Next, you can add files from a folder, website, spreadsheet, or archive to the project. We will be reviewing files from a folder, so click the `r keyboardButton("Add folder(s)")` button. You will be presented with the [Select Directory](#select-directory) dialog:

![](Images/selectdirectory.png)

Enter the path to your document folder in the top field. We will want to search for files inside of this folder and its subfolders, so leave **Search directories recursively** checked. Click the `r keyboardButton("OK")` button to accept, and the program will begin its file search. After the program is finished searching for documents, you will return to the **Select Files** dialog. Note how all of the files that were found are now included in the file list:

To add more files from other folders, repeat the previous step.

We will analyze all of the documents in this collection, so just ignore the **Randomly sample** option. Click the `r keyboardButton("Forward >")` button to continue to the **Document Structure** page, as shown below:

In this dialog, you will specify the format that best describes your documents. We are analyzing standard, narrative documents, so select **Narrative text**. After selecting your document structure, click the `r keyboardButton("Forward >")` button to continue to the **Test Selection** page, as shown below:

On this page, you will select how you want **Readability Studio** to choose the readability tests to perform. Select the **Recommend tests based on document type**:

We will be analyzing technical documents in this example, so select **Technical document or form**. Click the `r keyboardButton("Finish")` button and the project will be created and will appear like this:

The first items presented to us are the aggregated [statistics](#reviewing-batch-scores) for the test scores. This will give us a general overview of the collection's readability level. By looking at the **Means** column, we can see that the average reading levels of our documents are in the high-school range. Also, the mean [Flesch](#flesch-test) score is 54, which is somewhat difficult. The next column to review is the **Maximum** column. Here we can see that some of the higher test scores (e.g., 14.6) are into the collegiate level. From this, we can summarize that this collection is a little too difficult to read and that some documents need revising.

To view a breakdown of all the documents and their respective test scores, click on the **Raw Scores** subitem. Here we can [sort](#column-sorting) any of the test columns to see which documents scored the highest.

To view any document's scores in a vertical layout, double-click on its row in this list to display the **View Item** dialog:

![](Images/viewitemrawscores.png)

The distribution of these raw scores can also be graphically viewed. Click on the **Score Box Plots** icon on the project sidebar to view the box plots, and click on the **Histograms** icon to view the histograms. Box plots show the “spread” of each test's scores, whereas histograms show a test's scores divided into groups. For example, below is a histogram showing the **Flesch-Kincaid** scores:

![](Images/histogrades.png)

Judging from this graph, we have quite a few difficult documents in this batch. There are 11 files in the 12-13 range, which is not a comfortable reading level. Refer to [Reviewing the histograms](#reviewing-batch-histograms) and [Reviewing the box plots](#reviewing-batch-box-plots) for further information.

Now that we know which documents are scoring highly, we can begin revising them. The next step is to review any grammar issues that may be contributing to overly-long sentences. Click on the **Grammar** icon to display any grammar issues detected in the documents. First select the **Long Sentences** subitem, as shown below:

![](Images/batchlongsentences.png)

Here we can see which documents have the most overly-long sentences, as well as where the longest sentences are. Once we have found a document of interest, we may want to review it in greater detail. Select a document in this list and then click the `r keyboardButton("Subproject")` button on the **Home** tab. This will create a [standard project](#creating-standard-project), where we can review the long sentences individually. We can also view the document with these sentences highlighted in their original context. Note that standard projects can be created this way from any list which includes the document names.

Other tabs in the **Grammar** section are also available to help improve your documents. If any of these grammatical issues are encountered, then lists for [wordy items](#reviewing-batch-wordiness), [clichés](#reviewing-batch-cliches), [repeated words](#reviewing-batch-repeated-words), [lowercased sentences](#reviewing-batch-lowercased-sentences), and [conjunction-starting sentences](#reviewing-batch-conjunction-sentences) will be included. For the purpose of shortening sentences, the **Repeated Words** and **Wordy Items** tabs should be reviewed.

Once some of the documents have been revised, you can reload the batch project with the `r keyboardButton("F5")` button on your keyboard. As we can see in this updated **Flesch-Kincaid** histogram, there is already some improvement in this batch. There are no longer any documents scoring above the 12^th^ grade, and only 10 documents remain in the 10-12 grade range.
