## Amstad\index{Amstad|ii} {#amstad}

The Amstad test is a recalculation of [Flesch Reading Ease](#flesch-test)\index{Flesch Reading Ease!variations!Amstad} for German text. Its formula is adjusted from the original Flesch to take into account German's comparatively longer words. It also uses a lower weighting for the sentence-length factor, placing most of the influence on word length.

The factors used for this test are syllables per word (“*Silben pro Wort*”) and words per sentence (“*Wörter pro Satz*”). (The same factors used for Flesch Reading Ease).

Amstad (78-81) is best suited for school textbooks and technical manuals. Scores range from 0-100 (the higher the score, the easier to read) and average documents should be within the range of 60-70.

```{definition, amstad, name="Amstad formula"}
$$I = 180 - (W/S) - (58.5*(B/W))$$
```

Where:

|     | Description |
| --- | :-- |
| I   | Amstad (i.e., Flesch) index score |
| W   | Number of words |
| B   | Number of syllables |
| S   | Number of sentences |

Amstad offered these interpretations for scoring:

| Reading Ease Score | Description of Style | Typical Magazine |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 90-100 | Very easy | comics |
| 80-89 | Easy | pulp-fiction |
| 70-79 | Fairly easy | slick-fiction |
| 60-69 | Standard | digest |
| 50-59 | Fairly difficult | quality |
| 30-49 | Difficult | academic |
| 0-29 | Very difficult | scientific |

Like Flesch Reading Ease, this test treats numerals as monosyllabic words by default. This behavior can be changed from the [**Options**](#readability-test-options) dialog.

## Lix {#lix-german}

Refer to \@ref(lix-test).

## Lix\index{Lix!variations!German children's literature} (German children's literature) {#lix-german-childrens-literature}

This test is a German variation of [Läsbarhetsindex (Lix)](#lix-test) designed for children's literature. It uses the same index-score formula as Lix, but uses different scales for assigning the difficulty and grade-level scores. This adjustment was developed by Renström (152-153) and Bamberger & Vanecek (64, 187) for use with German literature ranging from 1^st^ to 8^th^ grade. (Renström developed the adjusted difficulty gauge; Bamberger & Vanecek developed the grade-level conversion.)

Note that this test differs from the original Lix approach of using the same scoring for any document, regardless of language. Instead, this test is designed specifically for German materials, adjusting the grade-level score and classification of the index value.

Regarding the index score, the following variation of the Lix gauge is used classify the difficulty (Renström 153; Bamberger and Vanecek 65; Schulz 53):

```{r germanLix, echo=F, fig.cap='German Lix Gauge', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/GermanLixGauge.png")
```

This version adjusts the scaling of the score, assuming that German text is inherently more difficult than other languages. It also includes additional levels of difficulty (e.g., “children and young adult”).

::: {.onsamepage data-latex=""}
To convert the Lix index score to a grade, this test uses the following table:

| Index Score | Grade |
| :-- | :-- |
| 0-23 | 1^st^ grade |
| 24-26 | 2^nd^ grade |
| 27-29 | 3^rd^ grade |
| 30-31 | 4^th^ grade |
| 32-33 | 5^th^ grade |
| 34-35 | 6^th^ grade |
| 36-37 | 7^th^ grade |
| 38+ | 8^th^ grade |

## Rix\index{Rix!variations!German (fiction)} (German fiction) {#rix-german-fiction}

This test is a German variation of [Rix](#rix-test) designed for fiction books. It uses a modified index-score formula from Rix, as well as different logic for assigning a grade-level score. This test was developed by Bamberger & Vanecek (64, 187) for use with German fiction ranging from 1^st^ to 11^th^ grade.

## SMOG (Bamberger-Vanecek)\index{SMOG!variations!Bamberger-Vanecek (German)} {#smog-bamberger-vanecek}

SMOG (Bamberger-Vanecek) (78) is a German variation of [SMOG](#smog-test) designed for secondary-age readers. This test calculates the grade level of a document based on complex-word density.

Note that numerals are fully syllabized (i.e., sounded out) for this test, so the program overrides your [numeral syllabication](#numsyllable) setting when calculating it.

```{definition, smogde, name="SMOG (Bamberger-Vanecek) formula"}
$$
G = \sqrt{C} - 2
$$
```

Where:

```{r, echo=F}
smogBVData <- tibble(" " = c("G", "C"),
                     "Description" = c("Grade level",
                                      "Number of 3+ syllable¹ words from 30 sentences"))

           escape=F, threeparttable=T)
```

This test requires a 10-sentence sample, with 3 samples being recommended for best results. ([Normalization](#glossary) can also be used to analyze larger samples or entire documents.)

## Wheeler-Smith (Bamberger-Vanecek)\index{Wheeler-Smith!variations!Bamberger-Vanecek (German)} {#wheeler-smith-bamberger-vanecek}

Wheeler-Smith (Bamberger-Vanecek) (77, 186) is a German variation of [Wheeler-Smith](#wheeler-smith) designed for both primary and secondary-age reading material. It calculates the grade level of a document based on [unit](#glossary) length and number of complex words.

```{definition, wheelersmithde, name="Wheeler-Smith (Bamberger-Vanecek) formula"}
$$
I = ((W/U)*((C/W)*100)) / 10
$$
```

Where:

```{r, echo=F}
wheelersmithBVData <- tibble(" " = c("I", "C", "W", "U"),
                             "Description" = c("Index value",
                                      "Number of 3+ syllable¹ words",

  footnote(number = c(markdown_to_kable_footnote('“*drei- und mehrsilbigen*”')),
           escape=F, threeparttable=T)
```

Then, find the index value in the following chart to acquire the final readability score:

| Grade | Score |
| :-- | :-- |
| First grade | 2.5 to 6 |
| Second grade | 6.1 to 9 |
| Third grade | 9.1 to 12 |
| Fourth grade | 12.1 to 16 |
| Fifth grade | 16.1 to 20 |
| Sixth grade | 20.1 to 24 |
| Seventh grade | 24.1 to 29 |
| Eighth grade | 29.1 to 34 |
| Ninth grade | 34.1 to 38 |
| Tenth grade | 38.1 to 42 |

::: {.notesection data-latex=""}
Although Bamberger and Vanecek (77, 186) do not specify using units instead of sentences, the use of units is assumed to match Wheeler-Smith.
