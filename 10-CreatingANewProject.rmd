# Creating a New Project

In this chapter, we will discuss how to get started by creating a new project.

To begin, click the `r keys("New")` button on the **Home** tab to display the **New Project** dialog. This dialog enables you to create either a [standard](#creating-standard-project) or [batch](#creating-batch-project) project. Note that batch projects are only available with **Professional Edition**.

**Standard project**: Select this option to create a standard project, which can analyze a file, a webpage, or typed text.

**Batch project**: Select this option to create a batch project, which can analyze a collection of documents or a website.

## Standard Project {#creating-standard-project}

To determine a document's readability you will need to create a new project. First, click the `r keys("New")` button on the **Home** tab to open the **New Project** wizard. (If you are using the *Professional* edition, select **Standard Project** and click `r keys("OK")`). On the first page of the wizard, the options for specifying the document and its language will be shown:

![](Images/wizard1.png)

::: {.notesection data-latex=""}
The language option is only available in the *Language Pack* and *Professional* editions of *Readability Studio*.
:::

The language option will control how the document is analyzed (e.g., syllable counting). This will also affect which tests, word lists, and grammar features will be available. For example, if we select **Spanish**, then only Spanish tests will be included, and features related to English word lists (e.g., New Dale-Chall) will not be available. For this example, select **English**.

The next options specify whether you will be analyzing a file or manually-entered text.

For example, to analyze an email, copy the text from your email program, select the **Manually enter text** option, and paste it into the text box.

To analyze a file, select the **Read text from a file or webpage** option. Then click the button next to the file path field and browse to the document:

![](Images/wizardentertext.png)

After you have selected your file, click the `r keys("Forward >")` button to continue to the **Document Structure** page, as shown below:

![](Images/wizarddocstructure.png)

On this page, you will specify the format that best describes your document. The compositions that you can select are either narrative text or [non-narrative/fragmented text](#framented-text). These options describe the content of your document and will help the program select the appropriate [text exclusion](#options-text-exclusion) method. The layout options are used to describe the format of the document and will help the program select the appropriate [sentence deduction](#options-sentence-deduction) method. For example, if your document is formatted to fit a page and also wraps its text around illustrations, then it is recommended to check both of the **Layout** options.

::: {.tipsection data-latex=""}
Previews of these document formats are shown next to each option. To view the full-size image of any preview, click on it with your mouse.
:::

After specifying your document structure, click the `r keys("Forward >")` button to continue to the **Test Selection** page, as shown below:

![](Images/wizardreadabilitymethods.png)

On this page, you will select how you want *Readability Studio* to choose the readability tests to perform. Your first option is to tell the program which type of document you are analyzing and it will select the most appropriate tests based on that. To do this, select the **Recommend tests based on document type** option. You will then be presented with the **Select the type of document...** options, where you can select which type of document best describes your file (e.g., a literary work or technical form), as shown below:

![](Images/wizarddoctypetechselected.png)

Your second option is to tell *Readability Studio* which type of industry your document relates to and it will select the most appropriate tests based on that. To do this, select the **Recommend tests based on industry or field** option. You will then be presented with the **Select the type of industry...** options, where you can select which field your file relates to (e.g., magazine publishing or the military), as shown below:

![](Images/wizardindustry.png)

Your third option is to manually select the tests yourself. To do this, select the **Manually select tests** option. You will then be presented with the **Standard tests** options, where you can select any of the tests that *Readability Studio* has to offer, as shown below:

![](Images/wizardtests.png)

The tests available on this page will depend on the project's language. For example, if you are manually selecting Spanish tests, then tests such as [Crawford](#crawford) will be available, but English tests (e.g., [Spache](#spache-test)) will not. Also, some industry and document-type options may not have tests associated with them depending on the selected language.

Your final option is to select a [test bundle](#test-bundles).

![](Images/wizardbundles.png)

Along with adding tests to a project, test bundles also can include [goals](#reviewing-goals) to help with reviewing your scores.

Note that you can always add or remove tests from your project at any time. If you select either the document type or industry options, you are not bound to the tests that *Readability Studio* recommends.

Finally, click the `r keys("Finish")` button and the project will be created and will appear like this:

![](Images/scores.png)

From here, you can review the [readability scores](#reviewing-test-scores) and [graphs](#reviewing-readability-graphs), useful document [statistics](#reviewing-statistics), and various lists of [difficult words](#reviewing-word-breakdowns). You can also review the document with its difficult words and [sentences](#reviewing-standard-grammar) highlighted.

## Batch Projects {#creating-batch-project}

To determine the readability of a document collection, you will need to create a new batch project. First, click the `r keys("New")` button on the **Home** tab to open the **Select Project Type** dialog, as shown below:

```{r echo=F, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/selectprojecttype.png")
```

Select **Batch Project** and click the `r keys("OK")` button to proceed to the **New Project** wizard dialog, as shown below:

```{r echo=F, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/wizardbatchselectfiles.png")
```

On the first page of this dialog, **Documents**, are options for selecting your documents and how to specify their language. The language option will control how the documents are analyzed (e.g., syllable counting). This will also affect which tests, word lists, and grammar features will be available. For example, if we select **Spanish**, then only Spanish tests will be included, and features related to English word lists (e.g., New Dale-Chall) will not be available. For this example, select **English**.

Now you can add files from a folder, archive file, Excel^®^ 2007 file, or website to the project.

To add files from a folder, click the `r keys("Add folder")` button. You will be presented with the [**Select Directory**](#select-directory) dialog:

```{r echo=F, fig.align='center', out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/selectdirectory.png")
```

To add files from an archive (i.e., a \*.zip file), click the `r keys("Add archive")` button. You will be presented with the [**Select Archive File**](#select-archive) dialog:

```{r echo=F, fig.align='center', out.width='30%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/selectarchive.png")
```

To add documents from an Excel 2007 file, click the `r keys("Add spreadsheet")` button. After selecting an Excel file, you will be prompted for which cells to import. After specifying these, the cells will be imported one of two ways. The first way is if a cell's content is a filepath. In this case, the document referenced by this filepath will be loaded into the project. Otherwise, if a cell is not a file path, then its content will be imported as a document itself. In this case, the cell's name (e.g., “B19”) will be used as the document's name.

To search for files from a website and include them in the project, click the `r keys("Add web pages")` button. This will display the [**Web Harvester**](#web-harvester) dialog, as shown below:

```{r echo=F, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/webharvester.png")
```

To add an individual web page to the project, click the `r keys("Add web page")` button. This will display a text box where you can enter the web page's path.

You can also select local files to include in the project. Click the `r keys("Add file(s)")` button and then select the file(s) that you want to include.

As you add files to the project, you can also include a helpful description next to any file. Double click in the **Description** column next to any filename, and then type a description to be attached to that file. When the batch project is loaded, this description will appear in any results window that displays filenames. (Note that for some file formats, the program will fill this field with the document's subject or title information if you leave it blank.)

After you have selected your files, you can randomly sample a subset of these documents for your project. Normally, you will want to analyze all the documents that you have selected and ignore this feature. However, some research projects may require random sampling. For these situations, check the **Randomly sample** option and enter the percentage of documents to analyze.

![](Images/randomsample.png)

Note that when the project is first analyzed, the documents that were not included in the sample will be removed from the project.

Click the `r keys("Forward >")` button to continue to the **Document Structure** page, as shown below:

![](Images/wizarddocstructure.png)

On this page, you will specify the format that best describes your document. The compositions that you can select are either narrative text or [non-narrative/fragmented text](#framented-text). These options describe the content of your document and will help the program select the appropriate [text exclusion](#options-text-exclusion) method. The layout options are used to describe the format of the document and will help the program select the appropriate [sentence deduction](#options-sentence-deduction) method. For example, if your document is formatted to fit a page and also wraps its text around illustrations, then it is recommended to check both of the **Layout** options.

After specifying your documents' structure, click the `r keys("Forward >")` button to continue to the **Test Selection** page, as shown below:

![](Images/wizardbatchreadabilitymethods.png)

On this page, you will select how you want *Readability Studio* to choose the readability tests to perform. Your first option is to tell the program which type of documents you are analyzing and it will select the most appropriate tests based on that. To do this, select the **Recommend tests based on document type** option. You will then be presented with the **Select the type of document...** options, where you can select which type of document best describes your files (e.g., a literary work or technical form), as shown below:

![](Images/wizardbatchdoctype.png)

Your second option is to tell *Readability Studio* which type of industry your documents relate to and it will select the most appropriate tests based on that. To do this, select the **Recommend tests based on industry or field** option. You will then be presented with the **Select the type of industry...** options, where you can select which field best describes what your files relate to (e.g., magazine publishing or the military), as shown below:

![](Images/wizardbatchindustry.png)

Your final option is to manually select the tests yourself. To do this, select the **Manually select tests** option. You will then be presented with the **Standard Tests** options, where you can select any of the tests that *Readability Studio* has to offer, as shown below:

![](Images/wizardbatchtests.png)

The tests available on this page will depend on the project's language. For example, if you are manually selecting Spanish tests, then tests such as [Crawford](#crawford) will be available, but English tests (e.g., [Spache](#spache-test)) will not. Also, some industry and document-type options may not have tests associated with them depending on the selected language.

Note that you can always add or remove tests from your project at any time. If you select either the document type or industry options, you are not bound to the tests that *Readability Studio* recommends.

After you have selected the tests to perform, click the `r keys("Finish")` button and the project will be created and will appear like this:

![](Images/batchscorestats.png)

From here, you can review the [readability scores](#reviewing-batch-scores), [box plots](#reviewing-batch-box-plots), [histograms](#reviewing-batch-histograms), [readability graphs](#reviewing-readability-graphs), [Dolch statistics](#reviewing-batch-dolch), and [difficult words](#reviewing-batch-words). You may also want to review any [warnings](#reviewing-batch-warnings) that were encountered while analyzing the documents.

### Select Directory {-#select-directory}

This dialog enables you to select a folder of documents for [batch](#creating-batch-project) analysis.

**Folder path**: Enter the path to the folder of documents that you want to include.

**File types to include**: Select from this list the types of documents to include from the folder.

**Search directories recursively**: Check this option to include files from all subfolders inside of the selected folder.

### Select Archive File {-#select-archive}

This dialog enables you to select an archive file (e.g., a compressed \*.zip file) that contains your documents for [batch](#creating-batch-project) analysis.

**Folder path**: Enter the path to the archive file that you want to include.

**File types to include**: Select from this list the types of documents to include from the archive. All files in the archive matching these document types will be included in the analysis.

### Worksheet Preview {-}

This dialog enables you to import a worksheet (from a spreadsheet) for [batch](#creating-batch-project) analysis. Note that only text cells can be imported as documents, so numeric cells will be blank here.

**Import**:

**All text cells**: Select this option to import the entire worksheet.

**Only highlighted cells**: Select this option to only import the selected cells (which will be highlighted blue). A block of cells can be selected by holding down the left mouse button and dragging the cursor around the block. Individual cells can be selected by holding down the `r keys("Ctrl")` (`r os_logo('windows')`) or `r keys("\\cmd")` (`r os_logo('apple')`) button on the keyboard and clicking the cells. Also, entire columns and rows can be selected by clicking the column header or row label, respectively.

Note that selections can also be discontiguous. For example, if you hold down the `r keys("Ctrl")` (`r os_logo('windows')`) or `r keys("\\cmd")` (`r os_logo('apple')`) button and click the column headers “A” and then “D,” then these two columns will be imported.
